File-based task structure and CLI command reference for `tasker`.

---

## Task Model

Everything is a **task**. Tasks are recursive — any task can have subtasks at any depth.

- A **story** (`s01`) is a root-level task. Story numbers are unlimited (`s01`, `s02`, … `s123`).
- **Subtasks** extend the parent ID by appending two digits after `t`. Each level adds exactly two digits, giving a limit of 99 siblings per parent.

### Task Forms

| Form | Structure | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Inline | ID + title in parent's `## Subtasks` bullet list | Leaf task, no description needed |
| Basic | `sNN-short-name.md` | Task needing description or inline subtasks |
| Extended | `sNN-short-name/README.md` + child files … | Subtasks that each need their own file |

All tasks have an ID regardless of form. A slug (and therefore a filename) is only needed when a task has its own file (basic or extended form).

Tasks **auto-upgrade** when structure requires it:
- Promoting an inline task to have a description → basic form (file created)
- Adding a subtask with `--details` to a basic task → extended form (dir is created, existing file becomes `README.md`)

Tasks **auto-downgrade** when structure allows it (triggered during `move`):
- Extended task with no file-based subtasks remaining → basic form (dir collapsed to single file)
- File-based non-root task with no description, no extra sections, and no subtasks → inline form (file removed, becomes a bullet in parent)

---

## Task ID Scheme

Stories use an `s` prefix followed by a zero-padded number (no upper limit):

```
s01   s02   s03   …   s123   …
```

Subtasks extend the parent ID with `t` (first level only) and then append two digits per nesting level:

```
s01t01          ← task 01 inside story s01
s01t0102        ← subtask 02 inside task s01t01
s01t010203      ← sub-subtask 03 inside task s01t0102
```

Rules:
- The `t` separator appears once, immediately after the story number.
- Every nesting level after that adds exactly **two digits** (01–99).
- Maximum 99 siblings at any level below a story.

---

## Filename Format

Files with their own file (basic or extended) include a short summary slug appended to the ID:

```
s01-design-file-structure.md
s01-design-file-structure/        ← extended form (dir)
  README.md
  s01t01-define-task-forms.md
  s01t01-define-task-forms/       ← nested extended form
    README.md
    s01t0101-first-subtask.md
    s01t0102-second-subtask.md
  s01t02-write-cli-spec.md
```

**Rules:**
- Slug is only required for basic and extended tasks (those with their own file)
- Inline tasks have an ID but no slug and no file
- Slug is kebab-cased, max 5 words
- Derived automatically from the task title, or set explicitly via `--slug`
- The slug is cosmetic — tasks are always addressed by ID alone (`s01`, `s01t02`, `s01t0102`)
- When referencing a task in commands, both forms are accepted:
  - `s01t01` — ID only
  - `s01t01-define-task-forms` — full filename stem (slug ignored for lookup)

---

## File Structure

### Basic task

```
tasker/
  s01-design-file-structure.md
```

### Basic task with inline subtasks

```
tasker/
  s01-design-file-structure.md    ← contains ## Subtasks bullet list
```

### Extended task (recursive)

```
tasker/
  s01-design-file-structure/
    README.md                     ← task description + list of subtask links
    s01t01-define-task-forms.md   ← basic subtask
    s01t02-write-cli-spec/        ← extended subtask
      README.md
      s01t0201-draft-commands.md
      s01t0202-write-tests.md
```

Root-level stories live directly under `tasker/`. Archived tasks move to `tasker/archive/`.

## Task File Format

```
---
id: s01t02
status: pending
---

# Title

Optional description text.
Can span multiple paragraphs.

## Subtasks

- [ ] s01t01: pending subtask
- [~] s01t02: in-progress subtask
- [x] s01t03: finished subtask
- [x] ~~s01t04: cancelled subtask~~
```

**Front matter** (YAML block between `---` delimiters) — required fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Task ID (e.g. `s01`, `s01t02`) |
| `status` | yes | One of `pending`, `in-progress`, `done`, `cancelled` |

| Status value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `pending` | not started |
| `in-progress` | being worked on |
| `done` | finished |
| `cancelled` | cancelled |

**`## Subtasks`** — present in the basic form when it has inline subtasks. Each line is a checkbox entry with the subtask ID and title.

For the **extended** form, `README.md` lists subtasks as links:

```
---
id: s01
status: in-progress
---

# Title

## Subtasks

- [ ] [s01t01](s01t01-define-task-forms.md): Define task forms
- [~] [s01t02](s01t02-write-cli-spec/): Write CLI spec
- [x] [s01t03](s01t03-finished-task.md): Finished task
- [x] ~~[s01t04](s01t04-cancelled-task.md): Cancelled task~~
```

---

## Checkbox Symbols

| Symbol | Status |
|---|---|
| `- [ ]` | pending |
| `- [~]` | in-progress |
| `- [x]` | done |
| `- [x] ~~…~~` | cancelled (strikethrough whole entry) |

---

## CLI Commands

All commands support `--json-output` for machine-readable output and `--debug` for full tracebacks.

### Add tasks

```bash
# Add a root-level story (slug auto-derived from title)
tasker new <title>

# Add a root-level story with explicit slug and description
tasker new <title> --slug <slug> --details <description>

# Create as a directory from the start
tasker new <title> --extended

# Add a simple inline subtask under any parent
tasker add <parent-id> <title>

# Add a subtask with details — auto-upgrades parent to extended form
tasker add <parent-id> <title> --details <description>

# Add with explicit slug (e.g. when created by AI)
tasker add <parent-id> <title> --details <description> --slug <slug>

# Add multiple inline subtasks interactively (empty line or EOF ends input)
# In --json-output mode: reads stdin silently, emits { "parent_ref": "s01", "task_refs": ["s01t01", ...] }
tasker add-many <parent-id>
```

### Update task status

Status commands accept one or more task IDs. Parent tasks with subtasks have their status managed automatically — use `--force` to override.

```bash
# Mark in-progress
tasker start <task-id>...

# Mark done (fails if task has open subtasks)
tasker done <task-id>...

# Force close even with open subtasks
tasker done <task-id> --force

# Cancel a task
tasker cancel <task-id>...

# Force cancel all open subtasks
tasker cancel <task-id> --force

# Reset a task back to pending
tasker reset <task-id>...
```

### Edit tasks

```bash
# Change title
tasker edit <task-id> --title <new-title>

# Change or add description (auto-upgrades inline task to file-based)
tasker edit <task-id> --details <new-description>

# Change slug
tasker edit <task-id> --slug <new-slug>
```

### Move tasks

```bash
# Move a task under a different parent
tasker move <task-id> --parent <new-parent-id>

# Promote a subtask to a root-level story
tasker move <task-id> --root
```

Moving re-generates task IDs to match the new location and prints the rename mapping. Source parents are auto-downgraded when possible.

### Archive

```bash
# Move root story to tasker/archive/
tasker archive <task-id>     # alias: arch

# Restore an archived story
tasker unarchive <task-id>   # alias: unarch
```

Only root stories can be archived. Archiving a non-root task is an error.

> **TBD:** Archiving of mid-tree tasks may be supported in the future.

### Recent task shortcuts

The last referenced task is saved to `tasker/.recent` (git-ignored). Shortcuts:

| Shortcut | Resolves to | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `q` | Last referenced task | If recent is `s01t02`, `q` → `s01t02` |
| `qNN...` | Descendant of recent | `q0103` → `s01t020103` |
| `p` | Parent of recent task | If recent is `s01t02`, `p` → `s01` |
| `pNN...` | Sibling via parent | `p03` → `s01t03` |

These shortcuts work in place of any `<task-id>` argument.

## Examples

```bash
# Create a root story
tasker new "Design file structure"
# → tasker/s01-design-file-structure.md  (Status: pending)

# Create with description
tasker new "Design file structure" --details "Define how tasks are stored on disk"
# → tasker/s01-design-file-structure.md  (description included)

# Add an inline subtask (no file created, gets an ID in ## Subtasks list)
tasker add s01 "Define task forms"
# → - [ ] s01t01: Define task forms  (in tasker/s01-design-file-structure.md ## Subtasks)

# Add multiple inline subtasks in one session (empty line ends input)
tasker add-many s01
#   Adding tasks to s01 (empty line to finish):
#   > Define task forms
#   task s01t01 added
#   > Write CLI spec
#   task s01t02 added
#   >
#   Done: 2 task(s) added to s01.

# Add a subtask with details — auto-upgrades parent to extended form
tasker add s01 "Write CLI spec" --details "Cover all commands and options"
# → tasker/s01-design-file-structure/README.md  (parent upgraded)
# → tasker/s01-design-file-structure/s01t02-write-cli-spec.md

# Add a subtask under a subtask — two digits appended
tasker add s01t02 "Draft commands" --details "List every command with args"
# → tasker/s01-design-file-structure/s01t02-write-cli-spec/README.md  (parent upgraded)
# → tasker/s01-design-file-structure/s01t02-write-cli-spec/s01t0201-draft-commands.md

# AI-created task with explicit slug
tasker add s01 "Implement command parsing" --details "..." --slug "impl-cmd-parsing"
# → tasker/s01-design-file-structure/s01t03-impl-cmd-parsing.md

# Reference by ID or full name — both work
tasker start s01t02
tasker start s01t02-write-cli-spec

# Close workflow
tasker done s01t0201
tasker done s01t02
# Error: s01t02 has open subtasks. Use --force to override.

tasker done s01t01
tasker done s01

# Cancel a task
tasker cancel s01t01
# → s01t01 cancelled (rendered as strikethrough in subtask list)

# Force cancel a parent with open subtasks
tasker cancel s01 --force
# → all open subtasks cancelled, parent cancelled

# Reset a task back to pending
tasker reset s01t01
# → s01t01 reset to pending (strikethrough removed if was cancelled)
```
